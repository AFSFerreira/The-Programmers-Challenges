## Challenge Description  
This challenge consists of:  

1. Implementing a program that finds a valid **Knight’s Tour**.  
2. The program must receive as input, via **command line**, a starting square in **chess algebraic notation** (e.g., `a1`, `h8`).  
3. The output must be a sequence of positions (one per line), in algebraic notation, representing the knight’s path through all 64 squares without repetition.
