## 📌 About the Project
This repository contains my **Python** solutions for the challenges proposed by the **[Os Programadores](https://osprogramadores.com/)** community.  

The purpose of this project is to practice problem-solving, reinforce programming logic, and apply consistent coding standards when developing algorithms.

⚠️ *Note:* Some challenges are not included here because they were discontinued during the community’s evaluation process.
