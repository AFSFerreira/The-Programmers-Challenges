    """
     Generates an infinite sequence of prime numbers
    using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.

     This generator function uses a dictionary to keep track of
    non-prime numbers and their smallest prime factors.
    It starts from the number 2 and iteratively finds the next
    prime number by checking if the current number is
    in the dictionary. If it is not, the number is prime and is
    yielded. If it is, the function updates the dictionary
    to mark the next multiple of the corresponding prime factor
    as non-prime. The dictionary is also optimized for
    memory usage by deleting old values.
